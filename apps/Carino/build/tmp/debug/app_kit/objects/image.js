/**
    NSImage adds very important methods to Image. Not only does it extend useful
    fnctionality into the default object, but it also extends the functionality
    to include caching of images, so that drawing controls constantly does not
    require re-downloading. Also, it supports sprites, such that images combined
    into a single resource can be referenced and dealt with as a single image.
    
    Drawing these images actually references the sprites, but user code sees it
    as a regular image. Spriting images dramatically improves performance and
    saves heavily on bandwidth.
