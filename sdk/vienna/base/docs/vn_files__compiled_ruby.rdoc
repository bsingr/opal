.vn files are compiled ruby, into byte codes. They also contain extra data as to their type. These files can either represent single ruby files, or, indeed a "bundle" of ruby files. A bundle is the equivalent of a ruby gem. It encapsulates lots of single ruby files, and extra information. This is useful to save multiple http requests to get each file for a "bundle". Bundles can, optionally, also contain data uri images (or mhtml) for saving bandwidth, json resources, yml resources, plain text, etc.
