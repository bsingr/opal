This is a testing area for font rendering using glyph drawing rather than the normal canvas font rendering.

Glyph rendering is by far preferential over canvas rendering, as glyph rendering gives us more control over
positioning of text, and indeed brings the Cocoa text system up to speed. 

Also, for temporary concerns, Opera cant draw text in the canvas, so this will allow Opera compatibility for
rendering.
