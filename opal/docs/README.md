Opal
====
Opal is a ruby implementation, written in Javascript, aimed at being run within
a web browser. Opal is tested in the most popular browsers, including Internet
Explorer. IE7+ is recommended if you must use IE, but IE6 runs opal reasonably
well. Note: IE6 performance is not great, and efforts will not focus on 
improving performance for this browser.
