# The code in this file can all be deleted. It is example code that shows the
# basic usage of the core opal runtime features. You can create multiple files
# and then include them as you would any other ruby project. Just make sure that
# you alter the build task in the Rakefile so that the Vienna build tools know
# to build the extra files. You can also alter your "main" ruby file in the
# tasks.
# 
# When ready, run "rake build" and then open index.html
